    <p>Welcome to a galaxy far, far away. Your job is to guess the word represented by the blanks before time runs out.
      If you think you know a letter included in the word, type that letter into your keyboard. Note: some words do have
      spaces that must be guessed, and all letters are lower-case! If you are correct, that letter will appear in the
      word. But beware: the Sith are about, and if you guess wrong, they may use the Force to take time away.</p>
